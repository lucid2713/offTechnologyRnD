              After the workshop ‘Electricity Matters’ last November at STEIM, I’ve been interested in playing with circuits in order to make instruments (and related stuffs).
              <br>While keep exploring with circuits and analog synth, I came up with an idea that combining circuit instruments with e-waste to make instrument.

            <h4>Sorting out e-waste</h4>
          </div>
          <div class="d1t-right">
              <p class="p-d1">
                I decided to make as many circuit instruments as I can from now on.
                <br>This time I would try with several different oscillator chips together with any kinds of possible components from e-waste.
                <br><br>
                I sorted out what kinds of components I can use from my e-waste collection.
                <br>This is the list of components I can directly re-use from e-waste.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>push button</li>
                <li>LED</li>
                <li>resistor</li>
                <li>capacitor</li>
                <li>switch</li>
                <li>transistor(line-through)</li>
              </ul>
              <p class="p-d1">
                According to this categorizing, I’ll combine these components with several different circuit instruments.
                <br>For the other e-wastes which are not sorted from this categorization, I can still use them as a resistor by connecting somewhere on their body to the circuit instruments.
                <br>I used them in this way before.
              </p>

            <div class="d2-two">
              <h4>Several tryouts</h4>
              <h5>Elektroslush</h5>
                <p class="p-d2">
                  I found a nice tool for catching and listening electromagnetic wave, which is ‘Elekrosluch’, developed by the lable LOM.
                  <br>I wanted to try it with curiosity, but it was sold out at the time and also a little bit expensive for me as well.
                  <br>Luckily, I found a tutorial on Make magazine, written by the Jonáš Gruska, who actually developed the elektrosluch at LOM.
                  <br>So following this guide, I made my own simple version of elektrosluch.
                </p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>

              <h5>Contact Microphone</h5>
                <p class="p-d2">
                  For the Shaky Grounds festival on June at my college, I started to collaborate with Lucija, who plays cello and studies at Conservatory since last March.
                  <br>I planned to make some interaction between cello and my installation, so I had to make a contact microphone to attach on the cello, so that I can manipulate signals from cello.
                  <br> I found a tutorial for contact microphone made by Marco Donnarumma, it was devised for his Xth sense project.
                  <br>It can catch up very subtle vibration and is easy to deal with using MaxMSP.
                </p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>

              <h5>Led Fans</h5>
                <p class="p-d2">
                  Besides making instrument, I was also working with computer fans to make them as interactive installation.
                  <br>The initial idea was to control the speed of each fan according to the signal from cello, but I couldn’t handle in that way.
                  <br>Thus I just used relay module with Arduino to turn on and off the fans at regular intervals.
                  <br><br>
                  Then I decided to use led strips instead for the interaction with cello.
                  <br>I could handle the illuminance of lights according to the signal that contact mic received from the cello by programming MaxMSP.
                  <br><br>
                  I put leds inside the paper cup, and put them behind the fans.
                  <br>So when activated together, the light spreads out through the fans, and this looks quite nice as the spinning fan makes light more softer.
                </p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>

              <h5>Metal detector</h5>
                <p class="p-d2">
                  While reading A Geology of Media by Jussi Parikka, I got to know that one of important recycling process at e-waste dumpsite is to excavate and sort out metal from all broken the parts.
                  <br>So I searched how we can detect metals and found there are quite easy ways to make DIY metal detector!
                  <br>I followed these two tutorials. (one, two links)
                  <br>Mostly this metal detector works with IC 555 timer chip in order to make sounds when it detects metal.
                  <br>This is also very cool for me as I’ve been generating sounds from e-waste so far.
                  <br><br>
                  Thus I decided to make a metal detector, the materials to make it would be from e-waste, and then use it to detect and find metals from e-waste.
                  <br>I thought not only it could be useful but also it could be very playful. I could see several thick coils(made from copper) among my e-waste, which is needed for metal detector.
                  <br>So I took one out from a complicated looking board and made a circuit with amp chip and this coil.
                  <br><br>
                  However, when I tried, I can hear sounds but it was not very distinctive whether it catches up the metal or not.<br>
              And there are many variables which affects accuracy of this metal detector such as the size of coil, values of resistors and capacitors.<br>
              Anyways when I tired with the same of resistors and capacitors as tutorials, the sound was not clear thus I guess I maybe have to try with more bigger coil.<br>
              However at the moment, when I just change the value of resistors and capacitors randomly, and put metals close to it, it makes sounds for some reason.<br>
              But I’m not sure if it works in this way anyhow.<br>

            <h4>Analog Circuit Synthesizer</h4>
          </div>
          <div class="d1t-right">
              <p class="p-d1">
                I began to work in earnest with analog synthesizer and e-waste together during the Spring semester.<br>
                I used some electronic components among my e-waste collection as a part of circuit instrument.
              <br>This process was quite interesting because each electronic waste has their own resistance value, so I could make different sounds from every different e-waste.
              <br><br>
              I made an oscillator with distortion and modulation, and connected 3 e-waste to the oscillator.
              <br>I liked the combination of sound of boiler component, ethernet adapter and floppy disc, so I played with this combination until the end of semester.
              <br><br>
              The book Handmade Electronic Music by Nicolas collins helped me a lot and the workshop with Nataliya Petkova as well for developing this work.
