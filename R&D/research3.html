          When we define something as trash, it implies that we consider it’s not worth any more. What determines its meaning and usefulness is based on the value that we assigned to it. And this value is often ‘economic value’ in many cases,
          especially in the case of things and stuff. Especially when things discarded, it reveals the loss of economic value. Thus waste means something useless or worthless. The digital technology is also valued in the same vein. Jennifer
          Gabrys remarks that “Waste reveals the economies of value within digital technology that render valueless, …” (2011, p. 17). When digital technology is thrown away and becomes trash, it is not worthless and valueless to its previous
          users.

          As Gabrys says, values are determined by the comparative criteria we give. So when electronics are thrown away to be considered worthless and useless, the value of which corresponds more with ‘utility’ than the ‘value’ of its own. The
          difference between value and use is described in ‘Facing Value’, by Maaike Lauwaert & Francien van Westrenen (eds.).

            <p class="quote-4">
          What makes understanding value even more complex, is the category of the useful: use and value are often equated, confused and mixed up. But not everything that is useful is valuable, nor is everything that is valuable useful.
          (Lauwaert & Westrenen, 2017, p.17)

            <p class="p-r3">
          As we can see in the quotation above, we often confuse value with usefulness. However, in practice, not all value is useful nor can all be said to be valuable. Let’s look at electronic waste. It is broken, less performative than new
          models, thus no longer useful. However, it doesn’t mean that it is worthless. Firstly, for commercial aspects, in fact, it has economic value, not as an entire entity as a ‘device’ but each component and materials consisting of the
          body of it. Apart from these substances that can be recycled and reused for being manufactured to another stuff, the broken or outdated electronics themselves can be still valuable in another meaning. More specifically the difference
          between value and use illustrated in Facing Value is as follows;

          Use is a concrete concept that can be even be measured in financial or monetary ways. Value is more ephemeral, more symbolic… (Lauwaert & Westrenen, 2017, p. 17)

            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="p-r3">
          In other words, use is a concept that can be measured by an economic basis. However, the value cannot be judged solely on a material basis.

          Then we can think value and usefulness separately when looking at electronic waste. E-waste can be seen useless as it doesn’t function well anymore. However, whether it’s valuable or not cannot merely be judged by its use and
          functionality. There are several ways to revive e-waste by making it useful again or making it worth and valuable. Recycling or upcycling is a way to revitalize the usability of e-waste. In this way, we can ‘use’ revived components
          for other purposes. It is a practical and economical way to deal with e-waste. And this approach happens in the industrial area but also can occur on a personal level. However, discovering a new value from e-waste can be a more
          creative way than focusing on its re-usability. Because it requires a perspective beyond economics, but imagination. Finding value from residues and abandoned leftovers is quite different from making it works again by giving
          operation. Although it is still useless, for instance, we could see it is playful and fun to be considered valuable. We can see examples of this way through several practices among hackers, makers, and artists, in a form of hardware
          hacking, circuit bending, etc.(e.g. <a href="https://www.nicolascollins.com/hackingworkshops.htm" target="_blank">&#128279;</a> <a href="https://www.electronicbeats.net/essential-guide-diy-instrument-building/" target="_blank">&#128279;</a> <a href="https://www.wired.com/2014/07/music-hacker-that-turns-e-waste-into-an-awesome-synth/" target="_blank">&#128279;</a> <a href="https://v2.nl/archive/works/re-cycles" target="_blank">&#128279;</a>) These practices can be described as tinkering and creating something from electronics rather than resuscitating the functions of it. And lots of cases,
          we can see creative outcomes in results - a new creature which embeds a new value and meaning.

          It is the lacks, the residues, and the excess that cannot be captured by capital’s mechanisms of valuation that will be explored in order to think beyond the logic of capital and show how values will always haunt value.

          In fact, exploring the broken and malfunctioning technology is not today’s new activity. According to Cascone in his text “The Aesthetics of Failure: ‘Post-Digital’ Tendencies in Contemporary Computer Music”, the approach to the
          failure of digital technology has been popular in many arts in the late 20th century. Artists have been interested in error and failures in digital technology and actively manipulated it to create new art. Especially in the electronic
          music, artists and musicians experimented with glitch art and noise music with this perspective.
          Cascone says, “Today’s digital technology enables artists to explore new territories for content by capturing and examining the art beyond the boundary of ‘normal’ functions and uses of the
          software.” (2002) To explore a new aesthetic through technologies’ failure is to consider digital technology not just as a tool for creation, but as an object of investigation and experimentation. This is a kind of approach to think the
          relationship between humans and technology in a different way. To step back and see what happens in and around digital technology. And then engage in a not normal sector of technology. Since sound artists like John cage had started to
          bring on ‘background sounds’ to the front(Cascone, 2002), glitch art in the '90s, and today’s tactical/critical art practices in digital technology, we can see this kind of approaches in art. Benjamin Gaulon(aka. RECYCLISM)’s art
          practices <a href="http://www.recyclism.com/">&#128279;</a> are one of the good examples about it.

          We could derive meaning from broken, dismantled, and outdated electronics. We can discover unknown value from e-waste by reappropriating broken, dismantled and obsolete electronics. Then, there will be an aesthetics of e-waste.

              I could get an idea from Dutch historian Johan Huizinga. In his book ‘Homo Ludens’(1938), the act of the play that we cannot evaluate with productivity, usefulness, and functionality, is one of the fundamental activities of human
          beings. The play makes human life enriched, although it is not necessarily related to productivity. Considering we humans as homo ludens, we can play with e-waste.
            <br>
          The problems and discourse around e-waste are still severe and significant. However, how much these problems are considered necessary in the daily lives of individuals? E-waste exists near around us, but it is too burdensome to
          embrace it in our daily lives. However, we can turn the seriousness into a playful world. It is not a disregarding the severity of the problem. Instead, it is a way to bring the issues and discussion closer to our lives. The play can
          draw huge and serious things mildly. As Huizinga addressed, the play doesn’t mean not earnest, although it seems opposition to it. Instead, play embraces seriousness. We can bring various discourse and problems e-waste holds more
          closely into our daily lives while playing with e-waste.

          How can we play with e-waste?<br>
          During the process of development, I accidentally found that we can make ‘sound’ from e-waste out of its left circuits and components. When combined circuits with sound chips and several components, e-waste now becomes musical
          instruments with noise sounds. It comes out that e-waste has ‘playful value’ in it!<br>
          <i>(More description about the process of instruments development, see D2.)</i>
                <br><br>
          When we throw away outdated electronics, they end up with being dumped. However, if we have an e-waste instrument that we’ve made by ourselves, electronic zombies(or fossils) becomes a toy for relieving the boredom and having fun. At
          least we wouldn’t discard it directly to the dump sites. We would know it almost has been thrown away before we create its playful value. Not only play music with e-waste instruments but also transforming e-waste into musical
          instruments can be an act of the play. Hands-on work (making e-waste instrument) is an active engagement to rethink about the value of e-waste and to recognize the being of e-waste. And then play sounds from it would create new
          meaning and value as an art as well as an activity. The two - making and performance - are essential to delivering the value of playful e-waste.
