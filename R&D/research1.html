          What is electronic waste? What usually considered as e-waste is electronic devices that we throw away to dump sites. In most cases, they are broken, malfunctioning or just outdated and out of trend, therefore make us lost interest.
        However, in a more broad perspective, not only abandoned hardware but also discarded digital files or data (which are immaterial forms) could be e-waste as well. Also, all the residues traced from electronics’ whole lives could be
        regarded as electronic waste. For instance, chemical contamination and Co2 emitted when electronics are manufactured and being dumped. These kinds of pollutants could be regarded as e-waste as well. Thus e-waste can be defined in
        various ways depends on how we categorize it. In this research, ‘discarded hardware’ is dealt with e-waste as the subject, focusing on its materiality.

        <p class="quote-2">
          Electronics continually perform in ways we have not fully anticipated. Electronic waste, chemical contamination, failure, breakdown, obsolescence, and information overload… (Gabrys, 2011, p. 4)
        </p>
        <br>

        <p class="p-rt">
          According to a report(2019) from the Platform for Accelerating the Circular Economy(PACE) and the UN E-Waste Coalition, there are more than 1,000 different substances in one electronics, and these materials are assembled
        complicatedly. Not only electronics are composed complicatedly with various materials, but also they don’t function only by either hardware or software. The hardware and software are very closely connected to make the device work. To
        make the software run, we need proper hardware that can support the performance of software - suitable chip, the connection of components, screens, wires, fans, and so on. Therefore hardware is not merely a shell. Not only the speed
        of development of software has been faster, but also the amount of new software coming out has been increased. This software development also requires new hardware that can support its upgraded functions. For example, an updated
        operating system for a new computer needs a more high-performance microprocessor. When a new software upgrade doesn’t support outdated smartphones anymore, the old smartphone doesn’t function well even though the hardware is not
        broken at all.
          <br>
          The software runs on the hardware. Therefore improvement of software requires the replacement of hardware. As a result, the hardware trash is made. In this context, Jennifer Gabrys says, “every upgrade will produce its corresponding
        electronic debris” in her book Digital Rubbish - research on the materials of electronic waste. (2011, p. 2) Consequently, it should not be overlooked that software is fundamentally dependent on hardware - the materiality, to support
        superior performance. Thus the digital technology is very dependent on the material.
        </p>
        <br>

        <p class="quote-2">
          But the proliferation of electronics occurs as much in the form of “hardware” as it does in programs or “software” -those seemingly more immaterial forms of digital technology, form information to networks, that still inevitably rely
        on material arrangements. (Gabrys, 2011, p. 3)
        </p>
        <br>

        <p class="p-rt">
          Also, digital technology is indeed the material itself. In the case of hardware, it consists of lots of elements. Notably, we can notice the materiality of electronics when it becomes e-waste. Gabrys says “In the dump, our digital
        media and technologies turn out to be deeply material.” (2011, p. 16) When electronics works and functions to be considered still useful and worth to us, it can be seen the functionality itself as a device. However, when thrown away,
        e-waste which is missing its functions and use now is the material itself.
        </p>
        <br>

        <p class="quote-2">
          It is estimated 50 million tonnes of e-waste is being produced annually in 2018, and it is going to be reached 120 million tonnes per year by 2050. However, only around 20% of e-waste is appropriately collected to be recycled at the
        moment. (PACE, 2019)
        </p>
        <br>

        <p class="p-rt">
          We can see materials in the e-waste landfill such as wires, circuits, buttons and PCBs(printed circuit board). If we take a closer look, we can also find raw materials like copper, gold, plastics, and so on. The numerous tiny
        components in electronics are glued together with the chemical solvent. To disassemble electronics to recycle, it needs lots of hands-on labor to sort out reusable materials. Moreover, this hard work takes place in several developing
        countries for cheap labor there. When unveiling the green image of ‘recycling’ e-waste, we can see the bare reality of offshore recycling - the e-waste trade between developed countries and developing countries. In several notorious
        e-waste dump and recycling sites like Agbogbloshie in Ghana, Karachi in Pakistan, and Guiyu in China, people who take this labor are exposed to toxic substances from e-waste without proper protections.

        <p class="p-rt">
          Several artists and photographers have been investigating the e-waste landfill worldwide to reveal the people, environment, and contamination around the dump. Photographs of Andrew Mcconnell’s ‘Rubbish Dump 2.0’ <a href="https://www.andrewmcconnell.com/Rubbish-Dump-2&period;0/8" target="_blank">&#128279;</a> and Kevin McElvancey’s
        ‘Agbogbloshie’ <a href="http://kevin-mcelvaney.com/portfolio/agbogbloshie/" target="_blank">&#128279;</a> reveals the life of people and the contamination around the dumpsite Agbogbloshie in Ghana. Also, a researcher, as well as artist Dani Ploeger deals with political, societal, and ecological issues around e-waste trade
        in his research project ‘e-waste performance’ <a href="http://www.e-waste-performance.net/" target="_blank">&#128279;</a>. These artistic practices unveil the reality of e-waste recycling, dumpsite, harsh labor, contamination of land and air, and e-waste trade.

            When looking at landfills as we can see google street view as well as photos from the artists mentioned above, we can see substantial e-waste mountains that are waiting to be disassembled and recycled. They look almost dead, but not
        entirely yet as they are not dismantled and returned to the soil. They exist as garbage. In other words, the electronic rubbish is not dead, but ‘existing’. In this sense, Gabrys named the e-waste as ‘fossils’. The life of electronics
        after thrown away become fossils, as they have not been extinct yet. In their text ‘Zombie Media: Circuit Bending Media Archaeology into an Art Method’, Garnet Hertz and Jussi Parikka call ‘zombie media’, as dead electronics are
        neither entirely dead nor alive anymore so that it looks like a zombie. (2012) As a fossil or a zombie, e-waste is co-existing with us. It is born to be dumped. However, the end is not death but exists.
          </p>
          <br>

          <p class="quote-2">
            Media never die but remain as toxic waste residue. (Parikka, 2015, p. 48)

          <br>

          <p class="p-rt">
            The paradigm of digital technology became ‘planned obsolescence’, which is the term Bernard London used to diagnose the consumer society already in 1932. <i>(add footnote)</i> The point when electronics becomes ‘waste’ happens once
        they lost any meaning for its users. It might not be easy to stop the planned obsolescence as an individual in society. However, it is users and individuals who decide to turn electronic to waste. Then why and how we decide to throw
        away them? When it’s outdated or malfunctioning so that it’s useless to us, we throw away electronics. However, what if it’s still valuable to us? What if we can make it worth again?
