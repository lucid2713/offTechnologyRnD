                <i>The digital revolution, as it turns out, is littered with rubbish. (Gabrys, 2011, p. 2)</i>
              </p><br>
              <p class="p-odd">
                Our society has been developed more technologically and digitally than ever. It goes toward the embedded and pervasive techno-integrated world. The current pattern on this development accompanies phrasing such as ‘faster,’ ‘better’
                and
                more. More information is generated than ever, thus to deal with it, the faster and better processing capabilities are required. Therefore, software that has better performances is released continually, and new hardware to support the
                new
                software is on the market accordingly. Nowadays the enthusiasm for the advance in the new digital world is great. Consequently, the cycle of technological development accelerates faster and faster.
              </p><br>
              <p class="p-even">
                It is not surprising to us the news about technologies newly produced and developed. The pattern of technological advancement is familiar enough to become insensitive to people living in the current digital society. In contrast, it
                seems
                less popular the news that illuminates the loopholes and back(dark) side of digital technology. However, there is extinction along with creation, and there is thing outdated which once was a newness in the past. When something new
                comes
                out, something suddenly becomes old and abandoned correspondingly. If we turn our attention a little bit, we could notice breakdown, obsolescence, and debris of technology. Facing those failures, let’s ask “What is newly abandoned?
                How
                and why?”. Moreover, “where this debris go?” instead of “What is newly coming out?”. The unrecognized old beings will shed a tear of joy for our little attempt to see them, which were shaded by technological advancement.
              </p><br>
              <p class="p-odd">
                Technology is designed to be useful to humans. For that purpose, we would pay attention to something more useful, and furthermore, better, newer, faster and even aesthetically cool looking ones. However, at this point, digital
                technology
                is already very profoundly penetrated our everyday lives, beyond the object as tools. It becomes our daily lives as well as it is guiding the direction of our society. Think about how much we rely on digital technology throughout the
                day.
                Also, how much we take advantage of digital technology and how much digital technology controls our daily lives. The role of digital technology can be said at the center of directing society’s development. It becomes the subject to be
                considered beyond what we see as merely a tool, as it takes up to considerable parts in our lives.
              </p><br>
              <p class="p-even">
                The image of digital technology we have - progress and advancement - is highly influenced by the main ideology of society, which can be described as onward and upward, more, better, and faster. According to this framework, the
                technology
                and the environment around it are formulated, so as our consciousness about technology. This research - off technology R&D - is an attempt to get out of this central ideology, and take an alternative viewpoint. With a different
                perspective, I try to look into the current aspect of digital technology and its development. I named ‘off technology’ for technologies that have been devaluated, lost their presence, and out of our interest. The image on digital
                technology we have mainly is something like future, fast, high-tech, and new. However, in reality, old, breakdown, and trash are also what digital technology looks like today. When we imagine the development and future of technology,
                we
                get not only hope and anticipation but also feeling of fear, threat, uncanny, and dystopian as depicted in SF movies and novels. Unlike this, when looking at the leftovers from digital technology, we could get compassion, sympathy and
                complicated feelings on it, by facing the severe problems around the digital debris. Based on this empathy, I question the dominant discourse on digital technology and pay attention to things abandoned and unnoticed. Then, I try to
                proceed useless but worthwhile research and development for off technology.
              </p><br>
              <p class="p-odd">
                In fact, not only in sociological, environmental, and ethical perspectives but also in an aesthetic point of view, off technology can be an intriguing subject. Therefore, this practice-based research is conducted at some point across
                the
                art, media, society, environment, and media-techno studies. Through the research, I explore digital technology’s debris, breakdown, pollution, failures, and garbage. Then, I proceed with development for creative reuse and
                reappropriation
                of off technology.
              </p><br>
              <p class="p-even">
                The first topic of off technology R&D is electronic waste (the hardware side) by focusing on the physical materiality of digital technology. First, the theoretical research on electronic garbage was conducted by referring to practices
                in
                the fields of sociology, media archaeology, and art. Based on the ideas found in academic research, the development was carried out to produce noise instruments using e-waste. This e-waste instrument consists of some components left
                over
                from broken electronics, and circuit boards I designed. The result of R&D is published on a webpage(<a href="#">&#128279;</a>), which everyone can access to the text as well as media files. I hope this R&D, which aims to be useless but worthwhile, could
                show
                the unusual way of proving the presence of e-waste. Moreover, it could guide us to look at e-waste differently and play with it creatively.

                <h2>Got an idea - e-waste instruments</h2>
                <p>After the workshop ‘Electricity Matters’ last November at STEIM, I’ve been interested in playing with circuits in order to make instruments (and related stuffs). While keep exploring with circuits and analog synth, I came up with
                  an idea that combining circuit instruments with e-waste to make instrument.</p>
              </div>
              <div>
                <h1>Handmade Electronic Music</h1>
                <h2>Sorting out e-waste</h2>
                <p>I decided to make as many circuit instruments as I can from now on. This time I would try with several different oscillator chips together with any kinds of possible components from e-waste.</p>
                <br><br>
                <p>I sorted out what kinds of components I can use from my e-waste collection. This is the list of components I can directly re-use from e-waste.</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>push button</li>
                  <li>led (led panel)</li>
                  <li>resistor</li>
                  <li>capacitor</li>
                  <li>transistor</li>
                  <li>switch</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <p>According to this categorizing, I’ll combine these components with several different circuit instruments. For the other e-wastes which are not sorted from this categorization, I can still use them as a resistor by connecting
                  somewhere on their body to the circuit instruments. I used them in this way before. </p>
                <br><br>
                <h2>What I've made</h2>
                <h3>Elektrosluch</h3>
                <p>
                  I found a nice tool for catching and listening electromagnetic wave, which is ‘Elekrosluch’, developed by the lable LOM. I wanted to try it with curiosity, but it was sold out at the time and also a little bit expensive for me as
                  well. Luckily, I found a tutorial on Make magazine, written by the Jonáš Gruska, who actually developed the elektrosluch at LOM. So following this guide, I made my own simple version of elektrosluch.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h3>Contact Microphone</h3>
                <p>For the Shaky Grounds festival on June at my college, I started to collaborate with Lucija, who plays cello and studies at Conservatory since last March. I planned to make some interaction between cello and my installation, so I
                  had to make a contact microphone to attach on the cello, so that I can manipulate signals from cello.<br>
                  I found a tutorial for contact microphone made by Marco Donnarumma, it was devised for his Xth sense project. It can catch up very subtle vibration and is easy to deal with using MaxMSP.</p>
                <br>
                <h3>Led Fans</h3>
                <p>Besides making instrument, I was also working with computer fans to make them as interactive installation. The initial idea was to control the speed of each fan according to the signal from cello, but I couldn’t handle in that way.
                  Thus I just used relay module with Arduino to turn on and off the fans at regular intervals.
                  <br>Then I decided to use led strips instead for the interaction with cello. I could handle the illuminance of lights according to the signal that contact mic received from the cello by programming MaxMSP.
                  <br>I put leds inside the paper cup, and put them behind the fans. So when activated together, the light spreads out through the fans, and this looks quite nice as the spinning fan makes light more softer.</p>
                <br>
                <h3>Metal Detector</h3>
                <p>While reading A Geology of Media by Jussi Parikka, I got to know that one of important recycling process at e-waste dumpsite is to excavate and sort out metal from all broken the parts. So I searched how we can detect metals and
                  found there are quite easy ways to make DIY metal detector! I followed these two tutorials. (one, two) Mostly this metal detector works with IC 555 timer chip in order to make sounds when it detects metal. This is also very cool for
                  me as I’ve been generating sounds from e-waste so far.<br>
                  Thus I decided to make a metal detector, the materials to make it would be from e-waste, and then use it to detect and find metals from e-waste. I thought not only it could be useful but also it could be very playful. I could see
                  several thick coils(made from copper) among my e-waste, which is needed for metal detector. So I took one out from a complicated looking board and made a circuit with amp chip and this coil.<br>
                  However, when I tried, I can hear sounds but it was not very distinctive whether it catches up the metal or not. And there are many variables which affects accuracy of this metal detector such as the size of coil, values of
                  resistors and capacitors. Anyways when I tired with the same of resistors and capacitors as tutorials, the sound was not clear thus I guess I maybe have to try with more bigger coil. However at the moment, when I just change the
                  value of resistors and capacitors randomly, and put metals close to it, it makes sounds for some reason. But I’m not sure if it works in this way anyhow.
                </p>
                <h3>Analog Synthesizer: schmitt trigger oscillator and its siblings</h3>
                <p>I began to work in earnest with analog synthesizer and e-waste together during the Spring semester. I used some electronic components among my e-waste collection as a part of circuit instrument. This process was quite interesting
                  because each electronic waste has their own resistance value, so I could make different sounds from every different e-waste.<br>
                  I made an oscillator with distortion and modulation, and connected 3 e-waste to the oscillator. I liked the combination of sound of boiler component, ethernet adapter and floppy disc, so I played with this combination until the end
                  of semester.<br>
                  The book Handmade Electronic Music by Nicolas collins helped me a lot and the workshop with Nataliya Petkova as well for developing this work.</p>

                <h3>Folking Room</h3>
                <p>The Exhibition Forking Room: Your Smart Neighborhood was held by Unmake Lab as a research project. The theme of forking room is associated with today’s society, technology and art. This year’s forking room consisted of exhibition,
                  talk, lecture and workshop. I participated the exhibition as one of artists with the video documentation of my e-waste instrument.</p>
                <h3>Terzetto</h3>
                <p>From 3th to 25th of November, I had another group exhibition at SIGN gallery in Groningen, Netherlands. The exhibition took place during the Sound of Music festival in Groningen so that the gallery invited 3 young artists who are
                  working on sound related art.<br>
                  I presented my e-waste instruments and the video documentation, and had sound performances at opening(on 9th) and closing(25th) events. For both performances, Lucija Gregov joined with her cello. (As we perform together as
                  experimental sound project fruit from the forest.)</p>
