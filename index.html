                <i>The digital revolution, as it turns out, is littered with rubbish. (Gabrys, 2011, p. 2)</i>
              </p><br>
              <p class="p-odd">
                Our society has been developed more technologically and digitally than ever. It goes toward the embedded and pervasive techno-integrated world. The current pattern on this development accompanies phrasing such as ‘faster,’ ‘better’
                and
                more. More information is generated than ever, thus to deal with it, the faster and better processing capabilities are required. Therefore, software that has better performances is released continually, and new hardware to support the
                new
                software is on the market accordingly. Nowadays the enthusiasm for the advance in the new digital world is great. Consequently, the cycle of technological development accelerates faster and faster.
              </p><br>
              <p class="p-even">
                It is not surprising to us the news about technologies newly produced and developed. The pattern of technological advancement is familiar enough to become insensitive to people living in the current digital society. In contrast, it
                seems
                less popular the news that illuminates the loopholes and back(dark) side of digital technology. However, there is extinction along with creation, and there is thing outdated which once was a newness in the past. When something new
                comes
                out, something suddenly becomes old and abandoned correspondingly. If we turn our attention a little bit, we could notice breakdown, obsolescence, and debris of technology. Facing those failures, let’s ask “What is newly abandoned?
                How
                and why?”. Moreover, “where this debris go?” instead of “What is newly coming out?”. The unrecognized old beings will shed a tear of joy for our little attempt to see them, which were shaded by technological advancement.
              </p><br>
              <p class="p-odd">
                Technology is designed to be useful to humans. For that purpose, we would pay attention to something more useful, and furthermore, better, newer, faster and even aesthetically cool looking ones. However, at this point, digital
                technology
                is already very profoundly penetrated our everyday lives, beyond the object as tools. It becomes our daily lives as well as it is guiding the direction of our society. Think about how much we rely on digital technology throughout the
                day.
                Also, how much we take advantage of digital technology and how much digital technology controls our daily lives. The role of digital technology can be said at the center of directing society’s development. It becomes the subject to be
                considered beyond what we see as merely a tool, as it takes up to considerable parts in our lives.
              </p><br>
              <p class="p-even">
                The image of digital technology we have - progress and advancement - is highly influenced by the main ideology of society, which can be described as onward and upward, more, better, and faster. According to this framework, the
                technology
                and the environment around it are formulated, so as our consciousness about technology. This research - off technology R&D - is an attempt to get out of this central ideology, and take an alternative viewpoint. With a different
                perspective, I try to look into the current aspect of digital technology and its development. I named ‘off technology’ for technologies that have been devaluated, lost their presence, and out of our interest. The image on digital
                technology we have mainly is something like future, fast, high-tech, and new. However, in reality, old, breakdown, and trash are also what digital technology looks like today. When we imagine the development and future of technology,
                we
                get not only hope and anticipation but also feeling of fear, threat, uncanny, and dystopian as depicted in SF movies and novels. Unlike this, when looking at the leftovers from digital technology, we could get compassion, sympathy and
                complicated feelings on it, by facing the severe problems around the digital debris. Based on this empathy, I question the dominant discourse on digital technology and pay attention to things abandoned and unnoticed. Then, I try to
                proceed useless but worthwhile research and development for off technology.
              </p><br>
              <p class="p-odd">
                In fact, not only in sociological, environmental, and ethical perspectives but also in an aesthetic point of view, off technology can be an intriguing subject. Therefore, this practice-based research is conducted at some point across
                the
                art, media, society, environment, and media-techno studies. Through the research, I explore digital technology’s debris, breakdown, pollution, failures, and garbage. Then, I proceed with development for creative reuse and
                reappropriation
                of off technology.
              </p><br>
              <p class="p-even">
                The first topic of off technology R&D is electronic waste (the hardware side) by focusing on the physical materiality of digital technology. First, the theoretical research on electronic garbage was conducted by referring to practices
                in
                the fields of sociology, media archaeology, and art. Based on the ideas found in academic research, the development was carried out to produce noise instruments using e-waste. This e-waste instrument consists of some components left
                over
                from broken electronics, and circuit boards I designed. The result of R&D is published on a webpage(<a href="#">&#128279;</a>), which everyone can access to the text as well as media files. I hope this R&D, which aims to be useless but worthwhile, could
                show
                the unusual way of proving the presence of e-waste. Moreover, it could guide us to look at e-waste differently and play with it creatively.
