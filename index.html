                <i>The digital revolution, as it turns out, is littered with rubbish. (Gabrys, 2011, p. 2)</i>
              </p><br>
              <p class="p-odd">
                Our society has been developed more technologically and digitally than ever. It goes toward the embedded and pervasive techno-integrated world. The current pattern on this development accompanies phrasing such as ‘faster,’ ‘better’
                and
                more. More information is generated than ever, thus to deal with it, the faster and better processing capabilities are required. Therefore, software that has better performances is released continually, and new hardware to support the
                new
                software is on the market accordingly. Nowadays the enthusiasm for the advance in the new digital world is great. Consequently, the cycle of technological development accelerates faster and faster.
              </p><br>
              <p class="p-even">
                It is not surprising to us the news about technologies newly produced and developed. The pattern of technological advancement is familiar enough to become insensitive to people living in the current digital society. In contrast, it
                seems
                less popular the news that illuminates the loopholes and back(dark) side of digital technology. However, there is extinction along with creation, and there is thing outdated which once was a newness in the past. When something new
                comes
                out, something suddenly becomes old and abandoned correspondingly. If we turn our attention a little bit, we could notice breakdown, obsolescence, and debris of technology. Facing those failures, let’s ask “What is newly abandoned?
                How
                and why?”. Moreover, “where this debris go?” instead of “What is newly coming out?”. The unrecognized old beings will shed a tear of joy for our little attempt to see them, which were shaded by technological advancement.
              </p><br>
              <p class="p-odd">
                Technology is designed to be useful to humans. For that purpose, we would pay attention to something more useful, and furthermore, better, newer, faster and even aesthetically cool looking ones. However, at this point, digital
                technology
                is already very profoundly penetrated our everyday lives, beyond the object as tools. It becomes our daily lives as well as it is guiding the direction of our society. Think about how much we rely on digital technology throughout the
                day.
                Also, how much we take advantage of digital technology and how much digital technology controls our daily lives. The role of digital technology can be said at the center of directing society’s development. It becomes the subject to be
                considered beyond what we see as merely a tool, as it takes up to considerable parts in our lives.
              </p><br>
              <p class="p-even">
                The image of digital technology we have - progress and advancement - is highly influenced by the main ideology of society, which can be described as onward and upward, more, better, and faster. According to this framework, the
                technology
                and the environment around it are formulated, so as our consciousness about technology. This research - off technology R&D - is an attempt to get out of this central ideology, and take an alternative viewpoint. With a different
                perspective, I try to look into the current aspect of digital technology and its development. I named ‘off technology’ for technologies that have been devaluated, lost their presence, and out of our interest. The image on digital
                technology we have mainly is something like future, fast, high-tech, and new. However, in reality, old, breakdown, and trash are also what digital technology looks like today. When we imagine the development and future of technology,
                we
                get not only hope and anticipation but also feeling of fear, threat, uncanny, and dystopian as depicted in SF movies and novels. Unlike this, when looking at the leftovers from digital technology, we could get compassion, sympathy and
                complicated feelings on it, by facing the severe problems around the digital debris. Based on this empathy, I question the dominant discourse on digital technology and pay attention to things abandoned and unnoticed. Then, I try to
                proceed useless but worthwhile research and development for off technology.
              </p><br>
              <p class="p-odd">
                In fact, not only in sociological, environmental, and ethical perspectives but also in an aesthetic point of view, off technology can be an intriguing subject. Therefore, this practice-based research is conducted at some point across
                the
                art, media, society, environment, and media-techno studies. Through the research, I explore digital technology’s debris, breakdown, pollution, failures, and garbage. Then, I proceed with development for creative reuse and
                reappropriation
                of off technology.
              </p><br>
              <p class="p-even">
                The first topic of off technology R&D is electronic waste (the hardware side) by focusing on the physical materiality of digital technology. First, the theoretical research on electronic garbage was conducted by referring to practices
                in
                the fields of sociology, media archaeology, and art. Based on the ideas found in academic research, the development was carried out to produce noise instruments using e-waste. This e-waste instrument consists of some components left
                over
                from broken electronics, and circuit boards I designed. The result of R&D is published on a webpage(<a href="#">&#128279;</a>), which everyone can access to the text as well as media files. I hope this R&D, which aims to be useless but worthwhile, could
                show
                the unusual way of proving the presence of e-waste. Moreover, it could guide us to look at e-waste differently and play with it creatively.

                <p>
                  Sep. - Oct. 2017<br>
                  Starting e-waste research.<br>
                  Before to set up my research topic and work, I already have an idea about what I want to do. <br>
                  I wanted to research about e-waste and want to find how to investigate this topic for my own work. <br>
                  As a first step, I started to do some outline/general research about e-waste. <br>
                  <ul>
                    What is E-waste? What can I discover around e-waste? What kind of artist and art works related? What can we do with e-waste?<br>
                    <li>Mind mapping</li>
                    <li>I’ve found several artists</li>
                    <li>I got interest in</li>
                    <li>How can I make?</li>
                  </ul>
                </p>
              </div>
              <div>
                <h1>Collecting</h1>
                <p>
                  Oct. 2017 - Dec. 2019<br>
                  I asked one Groningen facebook group that I’m looking for e-waste, and someone wanted to give away e-waste to me. <br>
                  I got 2 full boxes of e-waste from a guy who lives in the Groningen city center. <br>
                  Can you come by …?<br>
                  Sure I will! <br>
                  I brought ropes and bags with my bike.<br>
                  There were a lot, so I couldn’t bring all of them. This time, I sorted out several e-waste (around a third of them) and brought to my studio.<br><br>
                  Later.. I asked the guy if I could get the rest of them as well. I went to there again, and grabbed almost every e-waste left. He was actually happy with that cause he could remove all the trash! It was quite a lot and heavy, so I
                  had pretty hard time to carry them to my studio. I loaded all of them on my bike, and my bike was a bit overloaded, so I had to walk very slowly along the bike not to make it fall off. <br>
                  I felt like I became a ragman. Haha. <br><br>
                  In the mean time, my colleagues bring me some e-waste whenever they find it somewhere. I also picked up accidentally several e-waste around my college. In the basement, in the trash can, etc.<br>
                  A German colleague gave me a bunch of old floppy disk she found at her parents house. These floppy disks might have all the data from the family. And not I’m having them.<br>
                </p>
              </div>
              <div>
                <h1>Analyzing</h1>
                <h3>What kind of e-waste I collected?</h3>
                (Photos)<br>
                <p>Computer keyboards, Motherboards, hard disk, ram, fans, smarphones, wires, dvd player, boiler components, ethernet adapter, air conditional components, mouse, floppy disk, remote controller, scanner, dc and ac adapter, charger,
                  cables, and lots of parts that I don’t know where it comes from.</p>
                <h3>How do they look?</h3>
                <p>Most parts are broken and dead. Sometimes they still work (entirely or unstably) - still can be used e.g. Power adapter, wires, fans…<br><br>
                  Mostly, lots of dust on them. Several broken parts - very sharp and toxic as all the components are exposed without covers.. Smells toxic (chemical smell). Get hurts my fingers and hands. I had to put on gloves to protect my hands.
                  Sometime also had to wear mask for the dust and toxic smell.<br><br>
                  So many small components are one parts. They are attached very firmly, and components are very tiny. Glued with chemicals or soldered tightly.<br><br>
                  Composed of lots of metals. <br>
                  Also with Plastics. <br>
                  Some recognizable components - lets, registers, capacitors, chips, battery, socket for cables, camera, motor, button, switch, diode…<br><br>
                  Do they still work?<br>
                  Some power supply, mouse, connectors, and possibly?<br>
                </p>
              </div>
              <div>
                <h1>Tinkering</h1>
                <p>
                  After some theoretical research, I started to tinker with my materials to ‘make’ something with them. I got into an idea that the rapid cycle of being discarded and newly invented life of electronics.<br>
                  The AI and new robot, new digital devices are coming out continually, however, as much of old electronics are abandoned as a result. And they are now with me.<br>
                  So this idea came out as a e-waste robot? Object with the head of tablet displaying new AI and robot’s video.
                </p>
                <h3>The Future, Outdated </h3>
                <p>
                  As the first trial, I made an installation composed of electronic waste. It was exhibited at Orbit Fest, on Decemver, 2017.<br><br>
                  (photos and video link)<br><br>
                  An installation composed with electronic wastes. It looks like an outdated, abandoned and useless robot, once had been considered as our future. Meanwhile, it can be the future of newly-born robot which will be discarded soon after.

                The value of e-waste</h1>
              <p>
                When we define something as trash, it implies that we consider it’s not worth any more. What determines its meaning and usefulness is based on the value that we assigned to it. And this value is often ‘economic value’ in many cases,
                especially in the case of things and stuff. Especially when things discarded, it reveals the loss of economic value. Thus waste means something useless or worthless. The digital technology is also valued in the same vein. Jennifer
                Gabrys remarks that “Waste reveals the economies of value within digital technology that render valueless, …” (2011, p. 17). When digital technology is thrown away and becomes trash, it is not worthless and valueless to its previous
                users.

              <p>
                As Gabrys says, values are determined by the comparative criteria we give. So when electronics are thrown away to be considered worthless and useless, the value of which corresponds more with ‘utility’ than the ‘value’ of its own. The
                difference between value and use is described in ‘Facing Value’, by Maaike Lauwaert & Francien van Westrenen (eds.).
              </p>
              <p class="quote">
                What makes understanding value even more complex, is the category of the useful: use and value are often equated, confused and mixed up. But not everything that is useful is valuable, nor is everything that is valuable useful.
                (Lauwaert & Westrenen, 2017, p.17)
              </p>
              <p>
                As we can see in the quotation above, we often confuse value with usefulness. However, in practice, not all value is useful nor can all be said to be valuable. Let’s look at electronic waste. It is broken, less performative than new
                models, thus no longer useful. However, it doesn’t mean that it is worthless. Firstly, for commercial aspects, in fact, it has economic value, not as an entire entity as a ‘device’ but each component and materials consisting of the
                body of it. Apart from these substances that can be recycled and reused for being manufactured to another stuff, the broken or outdated electronics themselves can be still valuable in another meaning. More specifically the difference
                between value and use illustrated in Facing Value is as follows;

              </p>
              <p>
                In other words, use is a concept that can be measured by an economic basis. However, the value cannot be judged solely on a material basis.

                Aesthetics of e-waste</h1>
              <p>
                Then we can think value and usefulness separately when looking at electronic waste. E-waste can be seen useless as it doesn’t function well anymore. However, whether it’s valuable or not cannot merely be judged by its use and
                functionality. There are several ways to revive e-waste by making it useful again or making it worth and valuable. Recycling or upcycling is a way to revitalize the usability of e-waste. In this way, we can ‘use’ revived components
                for other purposes. It is a practical and economical way to deal with e-waste. And this approach happens in the industrial area but also can occur on a personal level. However, discovering a new value from e-waste can be a more
                creative way than focusing on its re-usability. Because it requires a perspective beyond economics, but imagination. Finding value from residues and abandoned leftovers is quite different from making it works again by giving
                operation. Although it is still useless, for instance, we could see it is playful and fun to be considered valuable. We can see examples of this way through several practices among hackers, makers, and artists, in a form of hardware
                hacking, circuit bending, etc.(footnote/links - hackers, makers, artists examples) These practices can be described as tinkering and creating something from electronics rather than resuscitating the functions of it. And lots of cases,
                we can see creative outcomes in results - a new creature which embeds a new value and meaning.

                In fact, exploring the broken and malfunctioning technology is not today’s new activity. According to Cascone in his text “The Aesthetics of Failure: ‘Post-Digital’ Tendencies in Contemporary Computer Music”, the approach to the
                failure of digital technology has been popular in many arts in the late 20th century. Artists have been interested in error and failures in digital technology and actively manipulated it to create new art. Especially in the electronic
                music, artists and musicians experimented with glitch art and noise music with this perspective.
                Cascone says in his text ‘The Aesthetics of failure’, “Today’s digital technology enables artists to explore new territories for content by capturing and examining the art beyond the boundary of ‘normal’ functions and uses of the
                software.” To explore a new aesthetic through technologies’ failure is to consider digital technology not just as a tool for creation, but as an object of investigation and experimentation. This is a kind of approach to think the
                relationship between humans and technology in a different way. To step back and see what happens in and around digital technology. And then engage in a not normal sector of technology. Since sound artists like John cage had started to
                bring on ‘background sounds’ to the front(Cascone, 2002), glitch art in the '90s, and today’s tactical/critical art practices in digital technology, we can see this kind of approaches in art. Benjamin Gaulon(aka. RECYCLISM)’s art
                practices are one of the good examples about it. <i>(ex. His works’ links)

                We could derive meaning from broken, dismantled, and outdated electronics. We can discover known value from e-waste by reappropriating broken, dismantled and obsolete electronics. Then, there will be an aesthetics of e-waste.

                Playful e-waste</h1>
              <p>
                Let’s find value in deceased and obsolete electronics beyond the logic of the economy.<br>
                How can we create another value from discarded electronics? How could we explore the aesthetics of turned-off technology?
              </p>
              <p>I could get an idea from Dutch historian Johan Huizinga. In his book ‘Homo Ludens’(1938), the act of the play that we cannot evaluate with productivity, usefulness, and functionality, is one of the fundamental activities of human
                beings. The play makes human life enriched, although it is not necessarily related to productivity. Considering we humans as homo ludens, we can play with e-waste.
                <br>
                The problems and discourse around e-waste are still severe and significant. However, how much these problems are considered necessary in the daily lives of individuals? E-waste exists near around us, but it is too burdensome to
                embrace it in our daily lives. However, we can turn the seriousness into a playful world. It is not a disregarding the severity of the problem. Instead, it is a way to bring the issues and discussion closer to our lives. The play can
                draw huge and serious things mildly. As Huizinga addressed, the play doesn’t mean not earnest, although it seems opposition to it. Instead, play embraces seriousness. We can bring various discourse and problems e-waste holds more
                closely into our daily lives while playing with e-waste.
              </p>
              <p>
                How can we play with e-waste?<br>
                During the process of development, I accidentally found that we can make ‘sound’ from e-waste out of its left circuits and components. When combined circuits with sound chips and several components, e-waste now becomes musical
                instruments with noise sounds. It comes out that e-waste has ‘playful value’ in it!<br>
                <i>(More description about the process of instruments development, see D2.)</i>
                <br><br>
                When we throw away outdated electronics, they end up with being dumped. However, if we have an e-waste instrument that we’ve made by ourselves, electronic zombies(or fossils) becomes a toy for relieving the boredom and having fun. At
                least we wouldn’t discard it directly to the dump sites. We would know it almost has been thrown away before we create its playful value. Not only play music with e-waste instruments but also transforming e-waste into musical
                instruments can be an act of the play. Hands-on work (making e-waste instrument) is an active engagement to rethink about the value of e-waste and to recognize the being of e-waste. And then play sounds from it would create new
                meaning and value as an art as well as an activity. The two - making and performance - are essential to delivering the value of playful e-waste.

                <p>After the workshop ‘Electricity Matters’ last November at STEIM, I’ve been interested in playing with circuits in order to make instruments (and related stuffs). While keep exploring with circuits and analog synth, I came up with
                  an idea that combining circuit instruments with e-waste to make instrument.</p>

                <h2>Sorting out e-waste</h2>
                <p>I decided to make as many circuit instruments as I can from now on. This time I would try with several different oscillator chips together with any kinds of possible components from e-waste.</p>
                <br><br>
                <p>I sorted out what kinds of components I can use from my e-waste collection. This is the list of components I can directly re-use from e-waste.</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>push button</li>
                  <li>led (led panel)</li>
                  <li>resistor</li>
                  <li>capacitor</li>
                  <li>transistor</li>
                  <li>switch</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <p>According to this categorizing, I’ll combine these components with several different circuit instruments. For the other e-wastes which are not sorted from this categorization, I can still use them as a resistor by connecting
                  somewhere on their body to the circuit instruments. I used them in this way before. </p>

                <h2>What I've made</h2>
                <h3>Elektrosluch</h3>
                <p>
                  I found a nice tool for catching and listening electromagnetic wave, which is ‘Elekrosluch’, developed by the lable LOM. I wanted to try it with curiosity, but it was sold out at the time and also a little bit expensive for me as
                  well. Luckily, I found a tutorial on Make magazine, written by the Jonáš Gruska, who actually developed the elektrosluch at LOM. So following this guide, I made my own simple version of elektrosluch.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h3>Contact Microphone</h3>
                <p>For the Shaky Grounds festival on June at my college, I started to collaborate with Lucija, who plays cello and studies at Conservatory since last March. I planned to make some interaction between cello and my installation, so I
                  had to make a contact microphone to attach on the cello, so that I can manipulate signals from cello.<br>
                  I found a tutorial for contact microphone made by Marco Donnarumma, it was devised for his Xth sense project. It can catch up very subtle vibration and is easy to deal with using MaxMSP.</p>
                <br>
                <h3>Led Fans</h3>
                <p>Besides making instrument, I was also working with computer fans to make them as interactive installation. The initial idea was to control the speed of each fan according to the signal from cello, but I couldn’t handle in that way.
                  Thus I just used relay module with Arduino to turn on and off the fans at regular intervals.
                  <br>Then I decided to use led strips instead for the interaction with cello. I could handle the illuminance of lights according to the signal that contact mic received from the cello by programming MaxMSP.
                  <br>I put leds inside the paper cup, and put them behind the fans. So when activated together, the light spreads out through the fans, and this looks quite nice as the spinning fan makes light more softer.</p>
                <br>
                <h3>Metal Detector</h3>
                <p>While reading A Geology of Media by Jussi Parikka, I got to know that one of important recycling process at e-waste dumpsite is to excavate and sort out metal from all broken the parts. So I searched how we can detect metals and
                  found there are quite easy ways to make DIY metal detector! I followed these two tutorials. (one, two) Mostly this metal detector works with IC 555 timer chip in order to make sounds when it detects metal. This is also very cool for
                  me as I’ve been generating sounds from e-waste so far.<br>
                  Thus I decided to make a metal detector, the materials to make it would be from e-waste, and then use it to detect and find metals from e-waste. I thought not only it could be useful but also it could be very playful. I could see
                  several thick coils(made from copper) among my e-waste, which is needed for metal detector. So I took one out from a complicated looking board and made a circuit with amp chip and this coil.<br>
                  However, when I tried, I can hear sounds but it was not very distinctive whether it catches up the metal or not. And there are many variables which affects accuracy of this metal detector such as the size of coil, values of
                  resistors and capacitors. Anyways when I tired with the same of resistors and capacitors as tutorials, the sound was not clear thus I guess I maybe have to try with more bigger coil. However at the moment, when I just change the
                  value of resistors and capacitors randomly, and put metals close to it, it makes sounds for some reason. But I’m not sure if it works in this way anyhow.

                <h3>Analog Synthesizer: schmitt trigger oscillator and its siblings</h3>
                <p>I began to work in earnest with analog synthesizer and e-waste together during the Spring semester. I used some electronic components among my e-waste collection as a part of circuit instrument. This process was quite interesting
                  because each electronic waste has their own resistance value, so I could make different sounds from every different e-waste.<br>
                  I made an oscillator with distortion and modulation, and connected 3 e-waste to the oscillator. I liked the combination of sound of boiler component, ethernet adapter and floppy disc, so I played with this combination until the end
                  of semester.<br>
                  The book Handmade Electronic Music by Nicolas collins helped me a lot and the workshop with Nataliya Petkova as well for developing this work.</p>

                <h3>Folking Room</h3>
                <p>The Exhibition Forking Room: Your Smart Neighborhood was held by Unmake Lab as a research project. The theme of forking room is associated with today’s society, technology and art. This year’s forking room consisted of exhibition,
                  talk, lecture and workshop. I participated the exhibition as one of artists with the video documentation of my e-waste instrument.</p>
                <h3>Terzetto</h3>
                <p>From 3th to 25th of November, I had another group exhibition at SIGN gallery in Groningen, Netherlands. The exhibition took place during the Sound of Music festival in Groningen so that the gallery invited 3 young artists who are
                  working on sound related art.<br>
                  I presented my e-waste instruments and the video documentation, and had sound performances at opening(on 9th) and closing(25th) events. For both performances, Lucija Gregov joined with her cello. (As we perform together as
                  experimental sound project fruit from the forest.)</p>
