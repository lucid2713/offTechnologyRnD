          Workshop ‘Data Cleansing Day’ is an activity for organizing and emptying data such as documents, photos, and videos stacked and replicated(backed-up) in the personal computer, external hard drive, or cloud storage.
          <br>
          Through this activity, we look back at the relationship between the vast amount of digital data we produce, save, replicate, and the physical digital infrastructures constructed to store what we make. The workshop aims not only to clean up our mind distracted by unorganized piled up files but also to get a clean emptied storage space. Furthermore, it is expected to contribute to producing much smaller data carbon footprints due to the reduced data storage.

          <h4>How to...</h4>
          <ol>
            <li>Bring your digital storage that requires data cleanup.
            <ul>
              <li>desktop/document/other folders in your PC&laptop; external hard drive; USB; photo
or video library; email; cloud drive (google drive/ dropbox/ etc); your favorite SNS;
</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
           </li>
            <li>Wear comfortable clothes and prepare a cup of tea to make your mind clean and relax.<br><br></li>
            <li>Before the start, follow the artist’s guide to warm up and meditate for about 5 minutes.<br><br></li>
            <li>Now start to clean up your data.
              <ul>
                <li>At first, take a screenshot of the unorganized, messy screen of your storage.</li>
                <li>There’s no particular way for cleanup. Just organize them in a way that’s convenient
and easy for you.</li>
                <li>One tip: Files that are duplicated too much, leave only one crucial thing. Delete files
which can be discarded. Don’t forget to empty the trash can at the end.</li>
                <li>If 1hour is too short, you can continue after the workshop.</li>
                <li>If your eyes hurt or neck aches during work, massage your eyes and stretch your
arms and legs.</li>
                <li>Have a sip of tea, too.</li>
              </ul>
              <br>
            </li>
            <li>Lastly, take a screenshot of the clean storage, and write down the time it took.
            <ul>
              <li>Share before/after photos and time spent with the artist. Then she will issue you a
data cleansing day certificate.</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
          </li>
            <li>Enjoy your clean digital storage with spare capacity. Thanks to you, the data carbon footprint must have been reduced a little bit!<br></li>
          </ol>
